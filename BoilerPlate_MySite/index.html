		<h2>Hobies</h2>
		<p>I love to design logos with Photoshop or Illustrator from Adobe. The main reason I had gotten into this is because i stream video games on something called <a href=https://go.twitch.tv/>Twitch.tv.</a> The illustrations are for my Youtube or my Twitch logos. Dont ask why but when I first started this stream I decided to make my name GoatMasterz. These are some things that i have worked on.</p>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/pinks/Desktop/PNG/Goat%20wink%20Emote.png" alt="GoatWink" width="300"/>
		
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/pinks/Desktop/PNG/Goat%20Back.png" alt="PandaGoat" width="300"/>
		<p>These pieces of work had taken me around 3-4 hours each. Funny fact, the image on the right was my first take on a goat. I was in love with it until everyone came to me and told me, "Wow, thats a good looking panda."</p>
		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>I have a job at the Mahomet IGA. I work around 30 hours a week which is a little bit of a struggle with the school work. The money earned is nice though.</p>
		
		<p>From time to time i go over to my mothers house to work there for a few extra bucks. We live on a farm and we also have a body shop that we own next to our house. There is always lots of work to do around there and getting $10 an hour is always nice.</p>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<p>I am in college at Parkland. This is my first year here. So far I am enjoying it very much. This has been easier than I had expected believe it or not. Reason being I believe is because the things that are being taught to me are things that I enjoy learning very much. Computers have always been something I have enjoyed learning about. These are some of the classes that I am taking currently</p>

	<p>My favorite class thus far is English 101. </p>
	<p>My least favorite class is my online class. Reason being is because it is difficult to ask questions for it is all online.</p>
		<h1>Family</h1>
		<p>My family line gets very confusing so i will attempt to make it brief. I have no full brothers or sisters, only half. I have 1 brother and 3 sisters. My mom lives near bloomington and my dad and i live here in Mahomet. We recently moved here from st.joseph about a half a year ago. I had moved to my Dads house when i was 13 years old. Reason being that i just wanted to see him more often.  </p>
